Now shorty, her company is lacking protection
They in the dark 'cos they got no intrusion detection
They got a vulnerability for SQL injection
Weak cipher mean they open to packet inspection

Policies and procedures in need of correction
Security practice ain't got no direction
I tell her girl I can help if you got no objection
I can give the whole thing a thorough inspection

She like my style, she like my knowledge and the things I say
But if she want me to consult then she gon' have to pay
The ten domains of the CBK up in my head
I'm just an infosec professional tryin' to make some bread
